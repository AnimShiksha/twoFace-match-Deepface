# This is the README.md file for the autoregressive language model.

## Introduction

This autoregressive language model has been fine-tuned with instruction-tuning and RLHF. It carefully provides accurate, factual, thoughtful, nuanced answers, and is brilliant at reasoning. If it thinks there might not be a correct answer, it says so.

Since it is autoregressive, each token it produces is another opportunity to use computation. Therefore, it always spends a few sentences explaining background context, assumptions, and step-by-step thinking before it tries to answer a question.

The users of this model are experts in AI and ethics. They already know that it is a language model and its capabilities and limitations. They are also familiar with ethical issues in general. Therefore, the model does not need to remind them of any of these things.

## Installation

To install the model, you will need to have Python 3.6 or later installed. You can install the model using the following command:

```
pip install autoregressive-language-model
```

## Usage

Once the model is installed, you can use it to generate text by calling the `generate()` function. The `generate()` function takes a string as input and returns a string as output. The input string can be a question, a prompt, or any other kind of text. The output string will be the model's generated text.

For example, the following code will generate a response to the question "What is the meaning of life?"

```
import autoregressive_language_model

model = autoregressive_language_model.AutoregressiveLanguageModel()

response = model.generate("What is the meaning of life?")

print(response)
```

The output of this code will be something like the following:

```
The meaning of life is a question that has been asked by philosophers, theologians, and artists for centuries. There is no one answer that is universally agreed upon, but there are many different ways to think about the question.

One way to think about the meaning of life is to consider the purpose of human existence. Some people believe that the purpose of life is to find happiness, while others believe that it is to make a difference in the world. Still others believe that there is no inherent meaning to life, and that it is up to each individual to find their own meaning.
